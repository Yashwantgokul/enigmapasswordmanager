The Enigma Password Manager Web UI is a sleek, user-friendly interface designed to provide secure and intuitive access to password management features. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the initial `index.html` serves as the sign-up page, featuring a clean form for users to enter their email and receive an OTP for verification. The design emphasizes simplicity and security, with a responsive layout adaptable to various devices. Future iterations will expand to include login, password generation, credential management, and account settings, all styled with modern aesthetics and enhanced with client-side validation and dynamic interactions.
